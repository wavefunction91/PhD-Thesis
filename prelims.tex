  The pursiut of scientific endeavours can not be done in a vacuum: it is largely a collaborative
  effort in the context of the scientific body as a whle. 
  As such, it would be  prudent to outline my contributions to the research presented in the
  following chapters.

  \Cref{ch:Theory} presents a reasonably in-depth overview of the theoretical preliminaries which
  provide a basis for the research in the chapters which follow. While a major part of my graduate
  research career was the pursuit of a deep understanding of these theories both from a mathematical
  and physical perspective, I would be remiss to attribute any of the fundamental theoretical
  developments outlines in  \cref{ch:Theory} solely to myself. \Cref{ch:Theory} depends heavily
  on the body of scientific literature relating to electronic structure theory and quantum mechanics
  in general: both contemporary and historical texts. The novel aspect of \cref{eq:Theory} is in
  the presentation of these methods in a cohesive and consistent manner such that the treatments of
  relativistic and non--relativistic theory are in a sense equivalent. This is
